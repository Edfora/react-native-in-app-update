# 1.2.* -> 1.3.*

### Android: Changing how we import core play dependencies.

- Google is moving away from a single `com.google.android.play:core` package, and instead itâ€™s splitting functionality into multiple packages.
The only one we need for this library is: `com.google.android.play:app-update` so we've changed the project to only require that package.

BREAKING CHANGES:

### Changed how we import constants

Change:

- `SpInAppUpdates.UPDATE_TYPE` to `IAUUpdateKind`

- `SpInAppUpdates.UPDATE_STATUS` to `IAUAvailabilityStatus ` (and `IAUInstallStatus`) depending on what the status relates to (read on).


The following:

```
PENDING = 1,
DOWNLOADING = 2,
INSTALLING = 3,
INSTALLED = 4,
FAILED = 5,
CANCELED = 6,
DOWNLOADED = 11,
```

are all installation statuses, therefore they all belong to `IAUInstallStatus` from now on.

While the statuses below:

```
UNKNOWN = 0,
UNAVAILABLE = 1,
AVAILABLE = 2,
DEVELOPER_TRIGGERED = 3,
```

describe the update availability, and therefore belong to: `IAUAvailabilityStatus`

- Also the way to import those from now in is this:

`import { IAUUpdateKind, IAUInstallStatus, IAUAvailabilityStatus } from 'sp-react-native-in-app-updates';`
